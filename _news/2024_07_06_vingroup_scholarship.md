Last week I had the memorable experience of attending the Pre-Departure Orientation and Award Ceremony for the Vingroup Scholarships Program.

Over the course of two days, we visited several Vingroup PnLs (Vinfast üöô , VinMec üè• , and VinAI ü§ñ) and had a campus tour of VinUni üè´. Best of all, I got to spend time with fellow Vingroup scholars - an immensely talented, deeply inspiring, and truly lovely group of people for whom I have nothing but admiration. 

The Science and Technology Scholarship Program, created by Vingroup, aims to award up to 100 scholarships per year for Vietnamese Master and PhD students to study in STEM fields at the top universities in the world. Each scholarship will cover the full tuition fee, plus a generous monthly stipend, airfare, settling allowance, and more for the recipient. So far, 690 billion VND has been given to 210 scholars (98 billion and 36 this year). Application usually opens around December of each year, and information on the scholarship, benefits, application process, etc. can be found on the scholarship's website: [Vingroup Scholarship Program](https://scholarships.vinuni.edu.vn/masters-ph-d-scholarship-program/). 

For me personally, this scholarship is my ticket to pursue my dream education, a Master's degree in Data Science at Nanyang Technological University Singapore. With the scholarship's support, I will be freed of any financial burden and therefore would be able to fully focus my energy on striving for academic excellence during my time in Singapore. I am really grateful to Vingroup for providing me with this wonderful opportunity.
