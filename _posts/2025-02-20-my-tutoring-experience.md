<p style="text-align: justify;">From Sep to Nov 2024, I was a <strong>Data Analytics Mentor</strong> (teaching assistant) at <strong>MindX Technology School</strong>. I mentored a group of 10 adult learners in Python, SQL and Power BI lessons. I expanded on concepts taught by the main teacher, guided students through technical exercises and provided them with practical advice on pursuing a career in data.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Between Dec 2022 and May 2024, I was a <strong>Data Analytics Mentor</strong> (internal trainer) at <strong>One Mount</strong>. I built a custom curriculum and taught a 5-lesson introductory SQL course for 30+ colleagues from the Marketing and Business Development department in Dec 2022. I gave practical advice on querying large datasets (billions of rows) and analytical methods specific to our business context.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within my data analytics team of 10+ (our population varied over the years), I led multiple training sessions on technical skills relevant to our projects: applied machine learning, machine learning explanability, inferential statistics, dimensional data warehouse design (most of which I self-learnt). Ocasionally, I shared my knowledge about soft skills, namely critical thinking and problem solving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Mar to Nov 2019, I was an <strong>IELTS Tutor</strong> (teaching assistant) at <strong>LinhUK IELTS School</strong>. I assisted in classes of 4 IELTS skills, working mostly with high-school and university students. I graded writing assignments and provided detailed feedback on how to improve grammatical structure, lexical usage, and idea development. I also trained individually with numerous students in speaking exercise, giving practical advice on pronounciation, intonation and building reflexes to test questions.</p>
